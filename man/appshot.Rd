\title{Take a screenshot of a Shiny app}
\usage{
appshot(app, file = "webshot.png", ..., port = getOption("shiny.port"),
  envvars = NULL)

\method{appshot}{character}(app, file = "webshot.png", ...,
  port = getOption("shiny.port"), envvars = NULL)

\method{appshot}{shiny.appobj}(app, file = "webshot.png", ...,
  port = getOption("shiny.port"), envvars = NULL, webshot_timeout = 60)
}
\arguments{
\item{app}{A Shiny app object, or a string naming an app directory.}

\item{file}{A vector of names of output files. Should end with \code{.png},
\code{.pdf}, or \code{.jpeg}. If several screenshots have to be taken and
only one filename is provided, then the function appends the index number
of the screenshot to the file name.}

\item{...}{Other arguments to pass on to \code{\link{webshot}}.}

\item{port}{Port that Shiny will listen on.}

\item{envvars}{A named character vector or named list of environment
variables and values to set for the Shiny app's R process. These will be
unset after the process exits. This can be used to pass configuration
information to a Shiny app.}

\item{webshot_timeout}{The maximum number of seconds the phantom application
is allowed to run before killing the process. If a delay argument is supplied (in
\code{...}), the delay value is added to the timeout value.}
}
\description{
\code{appshot} performs a \code{\link{webshot}} using two different
methods depending upon the object provided.  If a 'character' is provided
(pointing to an app.R file or app directory) an isolated background R
process is launched to run the Shiny application.  The current R process
then captures the \code{\link{webshot}}.  When a Shiny application object
is supplied to \code{appshot}, the Shiny application is run in the current
R process and an isolated background R process is launched to capture a
\code{\link{webshot}}.  Keeping the Shiny application in a different process
is ideal, shiny application objects are launched in the current R process to
avoid scoping errors.
